| Assignment 1 | Here you can find the solution to MLOps level 0: Training a model, creating an API with FASTAPI and creating a container with docker |  [Assignment 1](https://github.com/candemas97/MLOps/tree/main/assignment_1)  |
| Assignment 2 |     Here you can find a way in which you can run jupyter notebooks in docker, applying docker-compose to create the needed image     |  [Assignment 2](https://github.com/candemas97/MLOps/tree/main/assignment_2)  |
| Assignment 3 |                                         Here you can find a way in which you can run Airflow                                         | [Assignment 3](https://github.com/candemas97/MLOps/tree/main/assignment_3_f) |
|  Project 1   |                          Here you can find a data pipeline and ML Metadata using Tensorflow Extended (TFX)                           |     [Project 1](https://github.com/candemas97/MLOps/tree/main/project_1)     |
|  Project 2   |  Here you can find a way how to extract data from an external API using Arflow. Additionally, a way how to train a model from Airflow using MLFlow, storing the models in MySQL and MinIO. Finally, predicting using the trained model with FastAPI and Streamlit.  |     [Project 2](https://github.com/candemas97/MLOps/tree/main/project_2)     |

Within each folder you can find a README that explains how works each file to reach the solution.
