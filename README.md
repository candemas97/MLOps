Additionally, a way how to train a model from Airflow using MLFlow, storing the models in MySQL and MinIO. Finally, predicting using the trained model with FastAPI and Streamlit.                                                                                                                 |     [Project 2](https://github.com/candemas97/MLOps/tree/main/project_2)     |
|  Project 3   | Here you can find a way how to extract data from an external API (you canfind the data generation in this folder) using Arflow. Additionally, a way how to train a model from Airflow using MLFlow, storing the models in MySQL and MinIO. Finally, predicting using the trained model with FastAPI and Streamlit. Additionally, here you can see how to save the inputs given by the user and model prediction. One part of this project is run with Docker and the other part with Kubernetes. |     [Project 3](https://github.com/candemas97/MLOps/tree/main/project_3)     |

Within each folder you can find a README that explains how works each file to reach the solution.
